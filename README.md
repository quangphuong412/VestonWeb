These scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:
```

`dev`: runs next dev to start Next.js in development mode.
`build`: runs next build to build the application for production usage.
`start`: runs next start to start a Next.js production server.
`lint`: runs next lint to set up Next.js' built-in ESLint configuration.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

npx prisma migrate dev
